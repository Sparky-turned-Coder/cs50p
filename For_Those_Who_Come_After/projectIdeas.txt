SECTION 1: Projects (involving functions) 

 

Unit converter Factory 

Write a program that converts: 

Inches > centimeters  

Pounds > kg 

Fahrenheit > Celsius 

Hours > minutes 

Stipulations: 

Each conversion must be its own function.  

A master function routes calls. 

 

 

“Math Toolkit” CLI 

Write a program full of tiny functions: 

add(a, b)   

Subtract(a, b) 

Multiply(a, b) 

Divide(a, b) 

Max-of-three(a, b, c) 

Factorial(n) 

Is-prime(n) 

Fib(n) 

Then a main menu calls these functions.  

 

 

String Utilities Library 

Implement functions like: 

count_vowels(text) 

reverse_string(text) 

title_case(text) 

remove_punctuation(text) 

is_palindrome(text) 

word_count(text) 

Then write a small CLI “string analyzer” that lets you run each one. 

 

 

4. Dice Roller Engine 

Write functions that simulate different dice behaviors: 

roll_die(sides) 

roll_multiple(n, sides) 

roll_until(target, sides) 

drop_lowest(rolls) 

roll_stats() (like D&D stats calculator) 

This one is fun and very functional-programming friendly. 

 

 

5. ATM Simulation 

Everything is a function: 

check_balance() 

withdraw(amount) 

deposit(amount) 

print_receipt() 

Then a main_menu() function calls these.

SECTION 2: Projects (involving loops)  

 

 

1. FizzBuzz Variations 

Classic, but extend it: 

Standard fizzbuzz 

Reverse fizzbuzz (print backwards) 

Only print fizz cases 

Count how many fizzes, buzzes, and fizzbuzzes occur 

All of this is basically just looping. 

 

 

  2. Multiplication Table Generator 

Example:  

1   2   3 …  10 

2   4   6 …  20 

Then scale it: 

Let the user choose the size 

Add spacing alignment 

Format as a grid 

 

 

Pattern Printer 

Use loops to print shapes: 

Right triangle of stars 

Centered pyramid 

Diamond shape 

Rectangle border 

This is good practice learning nested loops and index control. 

 

 

Countdown/Count-Up Engine 

Build a program that: 

Counts up from 1 to N 

Counts down from N to 0 

Counts by 2’s, 3’s, user-chosen step 

Skips certain numbers  

All using while loops.  

 

 

Guess-the-Number Game 

The entire game loop is: 

Loop until guess is correct 

Count how many attempts user takes 

Give hints (too high/too low) 

Small, fun, loop-focused.
